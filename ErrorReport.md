1. Accessibility: Form Labels Not Linked to Inputs

Fault: In the Upload Form (UploadForm.test.tsx), text labels like "Category" are not programmatically connected to their corresponding dropdown menus (<select>) or input fields.
What it Looks Like in the App:
Clicking directly on the text label "Category" (or "Document Title", etc.) will not put the cursor into the associated form field or open the dropdown.
Users relying on screen readers will not hear the label ("Category") announced when they focus on the dropdown, making it difficult to know what the field is for.

2. Component Loading Error: NavBar Cannot Be Displayed

Fault: The application code for the Employee Pending Approval page (employee/pending-approval/tests/page.test.tsx) has an error related to how the NavBar component is imported or exported. It's trying to use something that isn't a valid component.
What it Looks Like in the App: The Employee Pending Approval page would likely crash or fail to load completely. Users might see a blank screen, a broken page layout where the navigation bar should be, or a generic browser error message.
(Related Test Failures: #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9)
3. Incorrect Page Content or State Display

Fault: Components are showing the wrong UI elements or data based on their current state.
In Employer Pending Approval (employer/pending-approval/test/page.test.tsx), the main "Pending Approval" title appears even when the page should still be showing a loading state.
Also in Employer Pending Approval, fetched data like the company name ("Pending Inc.") isn't being displayed; the fields remain empty.
What it Looks Like in the App:
Users might see the main page content flash briefly before the loading indicator appears, or the loading indicator might not show when expected.
On the pending approval screen, important details like the Company Name, Email, and Submission Date would be missing or blank.
(Related Test Failures: #1, #2)
4. Incorrect Error Handling / Navigation Logic

Fault: The application logic doesn't handle specific situations correctly after user actions or errors.
In Employee Sign-Up/In (signup/employee/tests/page.test.tsx), after a server error prevents sign-in, the user is incorrectly redirected to the main documents page instead of staying on the sign-in page to see the error.
In Category Management (employer/upload/tests/CategoryManagement.test.tsx), the code seems to allow adding a category even when the input field is empty.
In Role Selection (signup/tests/page.test.tsx), pressing Enter/Space on a role card doesn't visually apply the "selected" style.
Also in Role Selection, the expected redirect when no role is selected doesn't seem to happen.
What it Looks Like in the App:
A failed sign-in might confusingly send the user forward instead of showing an error.
Users might accidentally create categories with no name.
Keyboard navigation on the role selection screen wouldn't provide clear visual feedback.
The role selection page might get stuck or not redirect correctly under certain conditions.

5. API Communication Errors (Sign Up/Sign In)

Fault: When submitting the Employer Sign-Up or Sign-In forms (signup/employer/tests/page.test.tsx), the application code fails to make the necessary network requests to the backend API endpoints (/api/signup/employerCompany or /api/signup/employer).
What it Looks Like in the App: Clicking the "Sign Up" or "Sign In" button for employers would likely do nothing. The user would remain on the form, no error message might appear (unless specifically coded for this failure), and no account would be created or logged into because the app isn't actually sending the information to the server.
(Related Test Failures: #34, #35, #36, #37)
6. Potential Asynchronous Operation Failures

Fault: Actions involving multiple steps or waiting for server responses might be getting stuck.
In the PDF Test page (employer/pdfTest/tests/page.test.tsx), the button might not correctly show the "Asking..." state while waiting for an answer, or the process hangs.
In the Manage Employees page (employer/employees/tests/ManageEmployeePage.test.tsx), approving or removing an employee might not complete correctly, potentially leaving the UI in a loading state or failing to update the employee list.
What it Looks Like in the App:
Clicking "Ask" on the PDF test page might not give visual feedback that it's working, or it might never show the answer/error.
Clicking "Approve" or "Remove" on the Manage Employees page might cause a loading indicator to spin forever, or the employee list on the screen might never reflect the change.
(Related Test Failures: #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45)
7. Potential Performance Issues (Inefficient Rendering)

Fault: The Chat History component (ChatHistory.test.tsx) seems to be performing date formatting more times than necessary for the number of history items displayed.
What it Looks Like in the App: This usually doesn't cause incorrect behavior but can make the application feel slow or sluggish, especially when displaying long chat histories, as unnecessary calculations are being performed repeatedly.
