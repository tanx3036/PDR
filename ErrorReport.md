+ Form Selection Issues: On the UploadForm screen, the dropdown for selecting a document category would be present, but when users interact with it, it might not show the proper visual feedback. When a user selects an option, the selection might not be saved correctly or might reset unexpectedly.
Navigation Problems: Some pages would likely show blank areas or error messages where the NavBar component should appear. You might see React error boundaries or just white space instead of proper navigation elements.

+ Form Submission Failures: When adding a new category through the CategoryManagement interface, clicking the "Add Category" button might not do anything. The form would appear to submit (button click animation would work), but no new category would appear in the list.

+ Error Handling Issues: When operations fail (like document uploads or API requests), the application might show unhelpful or confusing error messages. For example, when a Q&A save fails, the error message might refer to "role checking" instead of explaining the actual problem.

+ Unexpected Redirects: Users might be unexpectedly redirected to the documents page when they shouldn't be, or kept on a page when they should be redirected after authentication issues.
  
+ Keyboard Navigation Problems: When trying to use the application without a mouse (for accessibility), pressing Tab and Enter to select roles on the signup page would not visually indicate which role is selected.
  
+ Date Display Inconsistencies: In the chat history, dates might appear in an incorrect or inconsistent format compared to what was intended.

+ Popup Message Issues: Error messages in popups might have slightly different wording than intended, and their behavior (like auto-closing or redirecting) might not work as expected.
  
+ Content Loading Problems: On the pending approval page, users might see the full content immediately even while data is still loading, leading to empty fields or partially rendered information.

+ Form Input Bugs: When typing in form fields (like in the company settings), the typed text might not update properly or might have unexpected characters.
